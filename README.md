Read the [full article](https://kinsta.com/blog/clone-site-kinsta-api).

## Installation
1. Clone or fork the repository.

## Kinsta Application Hosting Setup
### Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

### Environment Variables
When deploying, add the Kinsta API key and your company's ID as environment variables using the following variable name:

```bash
REACT_APP_KINSTA_COMPANY_ID = 'YOUR_COMPANY_ID' 
REACT_APP_KINSTA_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself, and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process based on the `npm start` in the `package.json` as the entry point.

### Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit), the `npm install` and `npm build` commands are run.
